DirBuster is a multi threaded java application designed to brute force directories and files names on web/application servers. Often is the case now of what looks like a web server in a state of default installation is actually not, and has pages and applications hidden within. DirBuster attempts to find these.

However tools of this nature are often as only good as the directory and file list they come with. A different approach was taken to generating this. The list was generated from scratch, by crawling the Internet and collecting the directory and files that are actually used by developers! DirBuster comes a total of 9 different lists, this makes DirBuster extremely effective at finding those hidden files and directories. And if that was not enough DirBuster also has the option to perform a pure brute force, which leaves the hidden directories and files nowhere to hide.

If you wanna install dirbuster print in terminal:
sudo apt install dirbuster

Nmap (Network Mapper) is a network scanner created by Gordon Lyon (also known by his pseudonym Fyodor Vaskovich). Nmap is used to discover hosts and services on a computer network by sending packets and analyzing the responses.Nmap provides a number of features for probing computer networks, including host discovery and service and operating system detection. These features are extensible by scripts that provide more advanced service detection, vulnerability detection, and other features. Nmap can adapt to network conditions including latency and congestion during a scan.
Nmap started as a Linux utility and was ported to other systems including Windows, macOS, and BSD it is most popular on Linux, followed by Windows.
Nmap was created in September 1997.He was writen by C,C++,Python,Lua.Nmap can audit the security of a device or firewall by identifying the network connections which can be made to, or through it.
Identifying open ports on a target host in preparation for auditing.
Network inventory, network mapping, maintenance and asset management.
Auditing the security of a network by identifying new servers.
Generating traffic to hosts on a network, response analysis and response time measurement.
Finding and exploiting vulnerabilities in a network.
DNS queries and subdomain search.If you wanna install this tool, you need write:sudo apt get-install nmap.In video what i pin in link, you unknow so many info about this scanner tool, and how to use it.
P.s You can use this playlist for unknow how to perfectly use nmap:

DMitry is a UNIX/(GNU)Linux command line application written in C. DMitry can find possible subdomains, email addresses, uptime information, perform tcp port scan, whois lookups, and more.
DMitry has a base functionality with the ability to add new functions. Basic functionality of DMitry allows for information to be gathered about a target host from a sim- ple whois lookup on the target to UpTime reports and TCP portscans.

The application is considered a tool to assist in informa- tion gathering when information is required quickly by removing the need to enter multiple commands and the timely process of searching through data from multiple sources.

To get straight into DMitry without reading this document, you can initially type "dmitry target", this will perform the majority of functions on the target.  
If you wanna install this tool write in console sudo apt-get dmitry or find tut in git repo:

P.s you can find tut in this link :)

Sqlmap is an open source penetration testing tool that automates the process of detecting and exploiting SQL injection flaws and taking over of database servers. It comes with a powerful detection engine, many niche features for the ultimate penetration tester, and a broad range of switches including database fingerprinting, over data fetching from the database, accessing the underlying file system, and executing commands on the operating system via out-of-band connections.
Attackers can use the tool to get into a database, and potentially the server
Sqlmap is capable of providing a sql shell into the database - allowing an attacker to potentially execute any arbitrary sql command.
Moreover, sqlmap also has an option to provide the attacker with an OS shell, with which the attacker can execute any arbitrary OS commands (Sql Injection leading to Command Injection)
Sqlmap will also try to crack user passwords when it finds hashes, using dictionary attacks - so attackers can even use this tool to get your passwords
Defenders can use sqlmap for penetration testing of their web applications, servers, and databases.
Use the tool to crack week passwords, assess whether the database is run with restrictive privileges, and to detect any potential injection holes in the application
If you wanna install this tool write in console:
git clone --depth 1 https://github.com/sqlmapproject/sqlmap.git sqlmap-dev

Hydra (or THC Hydra) is a parallelized network login cracker built in various operating systems like Kali Linux, Parrot and other major penetration testing environments. Hydra works by using different approaches to perform brute-force attacks in order to guess the right username and password combination. Hydra is commonly used by penetration testers together with a set of programmes like crunch, cupp etc, which are used to generate wordlists. Hydra is then used to test the attacks using the wordlists that these programmes created.

Burp or Burp Suite is a set of tools used for penetration testing of web applications. It is developed by the company named Portswigger, which is also the alias of its founder Dafydd Stuttard. BurpSuite aims to be an all in one set of tools and its capabilities can be enhanced by installing add-ons that are called BApps.
It is the most popular tool among professional web app security researchers and bug bounty hunters. Its ease of use makes it a more suitable choice over free alternatives like OWASP ZAP. Burp Suite is available as a community edition which is free, professional edition that costs $399/year and an enterprise edition that costs $3999/Year. This article gives a brief introduction to the tools offered by BurpSuite. If you are a complete beginner in Web Application Pentest/Web App Hacking/Bug Bounty, we would recommend you to just read through without thinking too much about a term.

The Metasploit Project is a computer security project that provides information about security vulnerabilities and aids in penetration testing and IDS signature development. It is owned by Boston, Massachusetts-based security company Rapid7.
Its best-known sub-project is the open-source Metasploit Framework, a tool for developing and executing exploit code against a remote target machine. Other important sub-projects include the Opcode Database, shellcode archive and related research.

The Metasploit Project includes anti-forensic and evasion tools, some of which are built into the Metasploit Framework. Metasploit is pre-installed in the Kali Linux operating system.

OWASP ZAP (short for Zed Attack Proxy) is an open-source web application security scanner. It is intended to be used by both those new to application security as well as professional penetration testers.
It is one of the most active Open Web Application Security Project (OWASP) projects and has been given Flagship status.

When used as a proxy server it allows the user to manipulate all of the traffic that passes through it, including traffic using HTTPS.

It can also run in a daemon mode which is then controlled via a REST API.

ZAP was added to the ThoughtWorks Technology Radar on May 30, 2015 in the Trial ring.

ZAP was originally forked from Paros, another pentesting proxy. Simon Bennetts, the project lead, stated in 2014 that only 20% of ZAP's source code was still from Paros.
